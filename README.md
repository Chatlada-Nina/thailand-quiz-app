## 🧠 Why This Project?

I created this app as a hands-on way to strengthen my **React** and **Tailwind CSS** skills. Instead of sticking to tutorials, I chose to learn by building something meaningful, interactive, and infused with my personality and cultural inspiration.

> This project helped me understand how to manage dynamic state, animations, conditional rendering, and responsive design — all while having fun creating a quirky, culturally flavored app!
